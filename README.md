# GreenIsTheNewBlack-Final-
This is the final implementation of our CSC 450 Project - Green Is The New Black

To be able to run this program you must have AndroidStudio installed and then open the project into the AndroidStudio IDE. 
Once the project has been loaded many times we have found you need to clean/rebuild the project the first time it is ran
on a new computer.

One the project has been loaded into the IDE, you must create an android imulator instance. We ran our project through a Nexus 5X that
was using the API 25 of Android. Also, we configured the phone to run on the Android version 7.1.1 with Google APIs included.
You must use the instance that has Google APIs included or the Google Maps feature will not be able to work on the emulator. 
Thank you, and hopefully you enjoy our endangered species learning application.

Also, included in the PHP folder are the different .php files that are implemented into our database to handle communication between
the Android App and the database that is hosted by 000webhost.com.
